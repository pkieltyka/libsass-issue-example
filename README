## @import bug - CASE 1: import "extra" uncommented / "extra-load" commented

[peter@pak ~/Development/other/sassc/bin]$ ./sassc fresh/main-import-confused.scss
/Users/peter/Development/other/sassc/bin/fresh/main-import-confused.scss:13: error: unbound variable $extra-a-color

## @import bug - CASE 2: import "extra" commented / "extra-load" uncommented

[peter@pak ~/Development/other/sassc/bin]$ ./sassc fresh/main-import-confused.scss
.something {
  color: "white"; }

.another-thing {
  color: "red"; }

.last-thing {
  color: "black"; }


## Include path bug

[peter@pak ~/Development/other/sassc/bin]$ ls
external/ fresh/    sassc*

[peter@pak ~/Development/other/sassc/bin]$ ./sassc -I "/Users/peter/Development/other/sassc/bin/external" fresh/main-include-path-broken.scss
/Users/peter/Development/other/sassc/bin/fresh/main-include-path-broken.scss:2: error: file to import not found or unreadable: "test"

.. I've tried every which way to pass the path to -I without any luck. This first came up when I was getting strange results with node-sass and noticed very simple files weren't being imported from the include path.
